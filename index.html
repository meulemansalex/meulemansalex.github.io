  <h1> About </h1>

  <div class="entry">
    Curious about how the world works, I started a bachelor in Engineering Sciences at KU Leuven in 2014. During these studies, I gravitated towards the mathematical beauty of modelling this world and creating new learning systems and that is why I started a master of Mathematical Engineering, also at KU Leuven. In my exchange and master thesis at ETH Zürich, I got excited about the synergy of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, leading me to start a PhD at the lab of prof. Benjamin Grewe in ETH Zürich in October 2019. Through mathematics, machine learning and neuroscience I want to provide a creative and fresh view on the 'intelligence' part of the artificial intelligence field and more specifically on how memory systems can help to make AI systems more intelligent. Besides my love for science, I'm a passionate musician and I'm busy with discovering as much of the beautiful Swiss Alps as possible.
