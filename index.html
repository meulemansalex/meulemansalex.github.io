  <h1> About </h1>

  <div class="entry">
    Curious about how the world works, I started a bachelor in Engineering Sciences at KU Leuven in 2014. During
      these studies, I gravitated towards the mathematical beauty of modelling this world and creating new learning
      systems and that is why I started a master of Mathematical Engineering, also at KU Leuven. In my exchange and
      master thesis at ETH Zürich, I got excited about the synergy of neuroscience and artificial intelligence,
      leading me to start a PhD at the lab of prof. Angelika Steger in ETH Zürich. Through mathematics,
      machine learning and neuroscience I want to provide a creative and fresh view on the 'intelligence' part of
      artificial and human intelligence. On the one hand, I design new theories for credit assignment in the brain
      (how does a neuron know how to change its synapses to improve the global behavior?), which is crucial for
      understanding learning in the brain, but surprisingly also very useful for learning on next-generation (analog)
      hardward, which has similar locality constraints as the brain.
      On the other hand,
      I draw inspiration from human intelligence to investigate currently unsolved problems in AI, such as long-term
      credit assignment in reinforcement learning and active perception. Besides my love for science, I'm a passionate
      musician and on the weekends, you can find me either skiing or hiking in the beautiful Swiss Alps.
